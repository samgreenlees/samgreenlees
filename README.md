 Hi, I’m Sam
 
 I’m interested in web development, creating with Pyhton and CAD. I"m also a sucker for good data visualization, 
 and like all good zoomers, game development was always my dream job as a kid.



I’m currently learning Python, SQL, Javascript, and CSS. I may start playing around with Unity and Unreal as well,
but as they say: "Better not put the cart before the horse."
